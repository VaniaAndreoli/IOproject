Description: This project quantifies and analyses the micronutrient supply and average micronutrient concentration of taxa exploited by fisheries in the Indian Ocean. It assesses associations among taxon-specific micronutrient concentrations, ex-vessel prices, fishing vulnerability, and climate vulnerability. The study highlights trade-offs and synergies among nutritional, economic, conservation, and climate resilience dimensions, providing insights for nutrition-sensitive fisheries management strategies.

Data Availability
Primary Data: Processed data on catch composition, micronutrient content, ex-vessel prices, fishing and climate vulnerability, and country-level comparisons are included in the data/ folder.

Raw Data: Raw or external datasets (e.g., Sea Around Us, FishBase) are not included due to size or licensing but are referenced and instructions for access are provided.


Folder Structure
data/: Contains processed data files used for analysis (e.g., .csv, .xlsx).

code/: Contains scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

output/: Generated figures and tables.
